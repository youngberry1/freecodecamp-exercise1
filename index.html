	<h1> Jollof Rice </h1>
	<p> Jollof rice is a popular and flavorful West African dish made primarily from rice, tomatoes, onions, and a
		variety of spices. It is known for its vibrant red color, which comes from the tomatoes and often includes
		ingredients like bell peppers, garlic, and ginger. The dish is typically cooked in a one-pot method, where the
		rice absorbs the rich, savory tomato sauce, creating a deliciously aromatic meal. Jollof rice is often served
		with grilled or fried chicken, beef, fish, or vegetables, making it a festive and versatile dish enjoyed across
		many countries, particularly in Nigeria, Ghana, and other parts of West Africa. Each region has its own
		variations, but it's always a staple at parties, celebrations, and family gatherings. </p>
	<h2> Ingredients </h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Rice </li>
		<li> Tomatoes </li>
		<li> Onions </li>
		<li> Bell peppers </li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Instructions </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Prepare the Rice:
			<ul>
				<li>Rinse the rice under cold water to remove excess starch.
				</li>
				<li> Set aside to drain.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Make the Tomato Blend:
			<ul>
				<li>Blend the tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, garlic, and ginger together until smooth. If you prefer a
					chunkier texture, you can blend them less finely.
				</li>
				<li>Alternatively, you can use canned tomato paste (about 1/4 cup) to enhance the flavor.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Fry the Tomato Paste (optional):
			<ul>
				<li>In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat.</li>
				<li>Add the tomato paste and fry for about 3–5 minutes to intensify the flavor. This step is optional
					but adds depth to the sauce.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Cook the Tomato Mixture:
			<ul>
				<li>Add the blended tomato mixture into the pot with the oil. Stir well.</li>
				<li>Allow the mixture to simmer for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should reduce
					slightly and thicken. If it's too thick, you can add a little bit of water.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Season the Sauce:
			<ul>
				<li>Add thyme, curry powder, paprika, bay leaf, cayenne pepper (optional), salt, and pepper to the
					tomato mixture.</li>
				<li>Stir well to combine the spices with the sauce, and let it simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Add the Rice:
			<ul>
				<li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir until it is well coated with the tomato sauce.</li>
				<li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, and add more water if necessary so that the rice is fully submerged by about an inch of liquid.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			7. Cook the Rice:
			<ul>
				<li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
				<li>Let the rice cook for 20–30 minutes, or until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. You can check the rice by fluffing it with a fork.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Allow to Rest:
			<ul>
				<li>Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		     Serve:
			<ul>
				<li>Fluff the rice with a fork and serve it hot with grilled chicken, beef, fish, or your favorite protein and vegetables.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
