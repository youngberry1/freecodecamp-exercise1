    <h1> Jollof Rice </h1>
    <p> Jollof rice is a popular and flavorful West African dish made primarily from rice, tomatoes, onions, and a variety of spices. It is known for its vibrant red color, which comes from the tomatoes and often includes ingredients like bell peppers, garlic, and ginger. The dish is typically cooked in a one-pot method, where the rice absorbs the rich, savory tomato sauce, creating a deliciously aromatic meal. Jollof rice is often served with grilled or fried chicken, beef, fish, or vegetables, making it a festive and versatile dish enjoyed across many countries, particularly in Nigeria, Ghana, and other parts of West Africa. Each region has its own variations, but it's always a staple at parties, celebrations, and family gatherings. </p>
